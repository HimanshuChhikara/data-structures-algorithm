Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number.


Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime. 
 

 Let us take an example when n = 50. So we need to print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 50. 
We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 50. 

According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 
 

 Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 
 

 We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it. 

 So the prime numbers are the unmarked ones: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.
